## Why This Dashboard?

### The Problem with Existing Tools

Popular wealth management platforms like **Monarch Money**, **Empower (formerly Personal Capital)**, **Tiller Money**, **You Need A Budget (YNAB)**, and **Pocketsmith** excel at account aggregation and transaction tracking, but they fall short in one critical area: **customizable executive-level KPIs and strategic wealth visualization**.

### Pain Points We Solve

1. **Missing Executive Metrics**: Traditional tools focus on budgeting and spending, not sophisticated metrics like FI progress, capital efficiency ratios, or concentration risk
2. **Lack of Customization**: Pre-built dashboards don't adapt to your specific financial strategy or goals
3. **Poor Strategic Visualization**: No unified view of asset allocation, liquidity runway, and financial independence metrics
4. **Platform Lock-in**: Your data is trapped in proprietary systems with limited export options
5. **No Lightweight Solution**: Heavy applications when you just need a quick executive summary

### Our Solution

This dashboard provides:
- **Instant Executive View**: See all critical wealth metrics at a glance
- **Platform Agnostic**: Export your account balances from any tool (Monarch Money, Empower, Tiller Money, YNAB, Pocketsmith, etc.) into a spreadsheet
- **Fully Customizable**: Adjust metrics, benchmarks, and calculations to match your strategy
- **Mobile Accessible**: Check your wealth metrics from any device
- **Zero Ongoing Costs**: No subscriptions, just a one-time setup

## Overview

This dashboard transforms your exported financial data into an interactive, visually appealing dashboard with strategic KPIs that matter for wealth building and financial independence.

## Features

3. **View your dashboard** with executive-level KPIs instantly

Example:
```javascript
const BENCHMARKS = {
    liquidityRunway: { low: 12, high: 24 }, // Months
    savingsRate: { strong: 30, excellent: 50 }, // Percentage
    // Modify as needed
};
```
